abstract="It is argued that a sophisticated question-answering machine that has the capability of making inferences from its data base should employ a certain four-valued logic, the motivating consideration being that minor inconsistencies in its data should not be allowed to lead (as in classical logic) to irrelevant conclusions. The actual form of the four-valued logic is `deduced' from an interplay of this motivating consideration with certain ideas of Dana Scott concerning `approximation lattices.'",

bookTitle="What is Negation?",
year="1999",
publisher="Springer Netherlands",
address="Dordrecht",
pages="23--51",
abstract="There are different treatments of the semantics of negation in non-classical logics, the most familiar of which is probably the Kripke definition of negation for intuitionistic logic. In two recent papers I have explored generalizations of Goldblatt's semantics for negation in orthologic (which uses the perp relation), and related these to the Kripke definition of negation for intuitonistic logic, and to the definition of De Morgan negation in relevance logic (which standardly uses the `star operator' *). The present paper in part surveys this earlier work, but the main focus is to connect the alternative four-valued semantics of De Morgan negation (using `overdetermined' and `underdetermined' truth values) to the star semantics (and hence indirectly to the perp semantics). This connection is based on semi-published work of mine from the 1960's.",
