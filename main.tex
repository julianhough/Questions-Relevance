\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We present in-progress work on modelling relevance in dialogue for questions and implicatures, setting out a programme of work on reducing the redundancy which classical logic introduces into proofs. To do this we firstly propose the use of relevance logics, then set out a lattice-theoretic generalisation of Knuth's and Hough and Purver's models of questions and answers. We suggest that by slightly modifying the underlying algebra, we can obtain formally adequate structures for Belnap's First-degree Entailment, a relevance logic.

\section{Introduction}
Formalizing what consists of a relevant contribution in a dialogue and particularly what constitutes a relevant answer to a question is now a classical problem for formal dialogue modelling. It has enjoyed a range of existing major treatments, clearly defined as a formal challenge from \newcite{Grice1975} onwards and made into a sub-discipline of pragmatics with Relevance Theory \cite{SperberWilson1986}.

Relevance was born out of Grice's original theory of implicature, where speakers implicate hidden meaning which hearers can make sense of as in (\ref{eg:griceparty}) from \cite{Davis2014implicature}.


\begin{equation}
\label{eg:griceparty}
\text{
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    Alan: & Are you going to Paul's party?\\
    Barb: & I have to work.
\end{tabular}
}
\end{equation}

While a literal interpretation of Barb's contribution would not permit it to be judged a relevant answer to Alan's question, the hidden meaning that can be inferred makes this possible. Deriving from Grice's account, as \newcite{Davis2014implicature} notes, ``Neo-Gricean theories have modified Grice's principles to some extent, and Relevance theories replace them with a principle of communicative efficiency. The problems for such principle-based theories include overgeneration, lack of determinacy, clashes, and the fact that speakers often have other goals." We add to this criticism by pointing out they also fail to give real-valued relevance measures to contributions, especially for answers to questions, though see \cite{HoughPurver2017Lattices} for one such approach in progress. In the current models the short polar answers `yes' and 'no' would have the same degree of relevance as Barb's actual answer above.

So, with the problems of goal intention recognition and lack of real-valued judgements at the heart of relevance theories, we here explore some formal models agnostic to a theory of intention recognition, but follow the spirit of principle of least effort and maximising relevance in communication. To do this we look beyond classical logical approaches and move to relevance logic approaches. We furthermore explore how real-valued relevance measures of answers to questions could be incorporated in such a framework. We would want to have a model which would put a real value on the degree of relevance of the contribution if certain reasoning is applied to yield the unsaid meaning and implicature.

Relevance in this setting is understood as ensuring every premise in a derivation is used. This has a connection in theoretical computer science to relevant type systems \cite{walker2005substructural} and numerous engineering applications,e.g. \cite{cheng2004temporal} or \cite{Bruns:2011:ACV:1952982.1952991}. We illustrate this below. 
%\par Relevance logics, viewed independent of their algebraic semantics, have a special logical and proof-theoretic significance: they are $\it{substructural}$ $\it{logics}$, in that they result from viewing propositions and their proofs in a system as resources. Indeed, the Relevance logic $R$ arises from classical sequent calculus by removing the weakening rule \cite{paoli2013substructural} in analogous way to Linear Logic being the result of removing contraction and weakening from the classical Gentzen sequent system. 

\section{An implicature example using a relevance logic}
Given (\ref{eg:griceparty}) and the availability of a general rule that may be available as a resource/reasoning pattern a speaker would have available to them like (\ref{def:workpartyexclusion}). we have rule which tells us when someone is working they can't attend a party (fairly reasonable consideration for most, unless one works in e.g catering, clown acts, etc). One cites the rule, and then concludes Barb can't go to the party at that time. In the spirit of \cite{Breitholtz2014}, we can derive a proof of the implicature that Barb's contribution can resolve the question using \cite{Mares2004}'s logical notation where the curly brackets indicate the premises used to derive the conclusion in Fig.~\ref{fig-relevancelogic}.

\begin{align}
    \label{def:workpartyexclusion}  \text{X is working at time }T \rightarrow \nonumber \\
    \neg\text{ X can go to a party at time }T\nonumber \\
    \textit{(work-party exclusion rule)}
\end{align}


The proof in Fig.~\ref{fig-relevancelogic} shows how both premises can be used to derive the conclusion in 4, which uses the implicature in 3. We are given as an initial question whether at a given time Barb can go to a party. We are also given that Barb is working at that time.

The problem here is that the initial question or premise is irrelevant to the proof. Indeed, all we need to obtain 3 is the work-party exclusion rule and 2.

\section{Towards Relevance Logic Lattices for Real-valued Relevance}

Bringing this discussion full circle, this is exactly analogous to the issues with Knuth's analysis of questions and answers. In Knuth's analysis, such questions trivially evaluate to $\top$ as any statement and it's negation result in a triviality ($\top$ or $\bot$ respectively). Indeed, $\top$ in Knuth's analysis is co-extensive with the entire space of questions and answers, which is counter-intuitive for any question with any content that does not involve asking whether something is true or false. Adopting a different underlying algebra helps block these issues, and seems to capably model relevance both as a conversational implicature and as a logical consequence relation.  

\section{Future Work}
In future work we would like to leverage the power of Knuth's question and statement lattices and the De Morgan lattices as described above for deriving a real-valued relevance of Barb's contribution to resolving the central issue. We only say that for now, this relevance is contingent on the the real valued inclusion of statement 3 in statement 2 after the application of the `work-party exclusion rule'-- if this is sufficiently high, we could rule this a relevant application of the general rule in order to derive 4.
\par We have evidence that Knuth's approach can be generalised already, and De Morgan algebras are (in addition to being the backbone of FDE described above) commonly investigated in fuzzy logic circles; it  forms an adequate algebraic semantics for e.g. Lukasiewicz logic \cite{Nguyen:1996:FCF:235242}.

\section{Algebras for Questions}
\subsection{Knuth and Lattices}
Our starting point for a formal analysis of questions and relevance is Knuth's ~\cite{knuth2005lattice}, in which he employs Boolean lattices as a means for analysing questions and answers in dialogue. Defining $x \le y = x \rightarrow y$, he suggests that two questions are equivalent if they are answered by the
same set of assertions. \par In using his definition of implication as defined on a lattice ordering, he can exploit natural properties of the lattice to conclude what the answers to a given question should be. Take the following example from ~\cite{knuth2005lattice}. `Who stole the tarts made by the Queen of Hearts?' is the question. For his example, there are three mutually exclusive statements $a, k$ or $n$ for `Alice stole the tarts!', `The Knave of Hearts stole the tarts!'or `No one stole the tarts!' respectively. We are told only one of these answers his question. The assertion lattice is depicted below:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (max) at (0,4) {$a \lor k \lor n = \top$};
  \node (a) at (-2,2) {$a \lor k$};
  \node (b) at (0,2) {$a \lor n$};
  \node (c) at (2,2) {$k \lor n$};
  \node (d) at (-2,0) {$a$};
  \node (e) at (0,0) {$k$};
  \node (f) at (2,0) {$n$};
  \node (min) at (0,-2) {$\bot$};
  \draw (min) -- (d) -- (a) -- (max) -- (b) -- (f)
  (e) -- (min) -- (f) -- (c) -- (max)
  (d) -- (b);
  \draw[preaction={draw=white, -,line width=6pt}] (a) -- (e) -- (c);
\end{tikzpicture}

In Knuth's analysis, if an assertion $x$ answers a question, then then the set of assertions $y$ that imply $x$ also answer that question. 

\defn[Downsets] Let $\mathfrak{L}$ be a lattice. Then for all $x,y \in \mathfrak{L}$, the $\it{Downset}$ formed from $x$: $\downarrow x = \{y | y \le x\}$ \\
Using the latter and the more general algebraic construction of $\it{order}$ $\it{ideals}$, Knuth can do two things exploiting the underlying Boolean algebra of assertions for a given question:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Deduce the answers to a given question;
    \item Produce the lattice of questions for which the assertion lattice provides answers.
\end{enumerate}
\example \label{sec-example}If indeed Alice stole the tarts, $\downarrow$$a = \{\bot, a\}$ gives the answer set to the question of who stole the tarts (Alice and $\bot$).\\ 
\par This construction introduces irrelevance in the answer set: $\bot$ conveys no information at all ($\bot$ is not a person in the domain but a constant across Boolean algebras), yet by Knuth's construction $\bot$ is in $\it{every}$ answer set. This is undesirable, for intuitively, if we know one or more answers are correct and relevant for a question, we want those answers alone. This means we seek to rule out trivialities and vacuous information in our answer set. \footnote{Similarly, as $\bot = a \land \neg a$ in a Boolean algebra, $a \land \neg a$ is an odd answer to the question of who stole the tarts, but it is nonetheless valid under the present model, and will answer every question posed, as it is equivalent to $\bot$.} % \footnote{There are more issues of irrelevance here as well. For instance, since ideals ( all downsets are ideals) are closed under finite join, if $\{\bot, a\}$ is an ideal in the assertion lattice, and $a \lor a$ is an answer given by this ideal. This is irrelevant, as if $a$ really is true, even if $a \lor a$ is trivially true we would not want it in our answer set as it conveys no more information than $a$.} 
%~\ref{sec:length}.


\subsection{De Morgan Algebras}
With this in mind, we have two observations which we think can resolve the above problem. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change the construction.
    \item Change the algebra.\footnote{Both are necessary, as improving the construction does not affect the global irrelevance of the underlying algebra (and doesn't guarantee us the connection to FDE). In changing the algebra one gains tighter control over the answer set, but the construction must still be modified slightly to preserve the desired relevant answers.}
\end{enumerate}

\defn[De Morgan Algebras] $\mathfrak{A} = (A, \lor, \land, \bot, \top)$ is a bounded distributive lattice, and
$\neg$ is a De Morgan involution: $\neg(x \land y) = \neg 
x \lor \neg y$ and $\neg\neg x = x$. We say that $\mathfrak{A}$ is a De Morgan Algebra.

\note $\mathfrak{A}$ is a proper subalgebra of the Boolean algebra, as $(x \land \neg x) \neq \bot$ and $(x \lor \neg x) \neq \top$. If we add $(x \land \neg x) = \bot$ or its dual, we obtain a Boolean algebra. 

\defn[Modified Downsets] Define $\downarrow x\prime := \downarrow x \setminus \{\bot\}$. In words: $\downarrow x\prime$ is the downset relation of before, but without $\bot$. 

\example cf. \ref{sec-example} : $\downarrow x\prime = \{a\}$.

\remark These considerations give us a tighter control over the set of relevant questions. To see that this is so in the setting of Knuth's example, take the assertion lattice. Since $\neg$ is a dual automorphism on the algebra, we get the following by inverting the lattice:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (max) at (0,4) {$\neg(\bot) = \top$};
  \node (a) at (-2,2) {$\neg(a)$};
  \node (b) at (0,2) {$\neg(k)$};
  \node (c) at (2,2) {$\neg(n)$};
  \node (d) at (-2,0) {$\neg(a \lor k)$};
  \node (e) at (0,0) {$\neg(a \lor n)$};
  \node (f) at (2,0) {$\neg(k \lor n)$};
  \node (min) at (0,-2) {$\neg(a \lor k \lor n) = \neg(\top) = \bot$};
  \draw (min) -- (d) -- (a) -- (max) -- (b) -- (f)
  (e) -- (min) -- (f) -- (c) -- (max)
  (d) -- (b);
  \draw[preaction={draw=white, -,line width=6pt}] (a) -- (e) -- (c);
\end{tikzpicture}

In particular, $a \land \neg a \neq \bot$.%\footnote{The use of $\prime$ merely indicates that the resultant $\top$ or $\bot$ results from an involution of the old $\top$ and $\bot$.}
\remark Note that $\top$ and $\bot$ still hold their rightful places in the ordering and the behavior of the lattice is otherwise familiar. This structure is just weak enough to carry out much of Knuth's analysis but strong enough to sieve out irrelevant assertions. It turns out this connection is more than skin deep.
\section{Relevance via Logic}
\subsection{The Connection with Relevance logics}
De Morgan algebras have been studied at least since \cite{10.2307/1993112} as algebras in their own right, but work of Dunn \cite{Dunn1999}, Belnap \cite{Belnap1977} and their collaborators \cite{anderson2017entailment} conveys a deep connection between De Morgan algebras and a Relevant logic known to cognoscenti as First-Degree Entailment (FDE). The logic itself is one of the first successfully explored variants of Relevant logic, and indeed has a variety of semantics on offer (relational, matrices, algebraic), each of which are formally adequate for the system \cite{omori201740}. The key is that the algebraic semantics delivers insights not easily derived by matrix calculations or relational semantics, and forms the most general semantic perspective on offer for FDE, and serves as a blueprint for further generalisation in other cases (De Morgan Monoids, Dunn monoids, etc.). 
\subsection{Belnap's FDE}
\par Sadly, there is not one best system of relevance logic - there are many varieties of relevance logics \cite{anderson2017entailment}. \ref{table-fde-logic} presents a sequent-style natural deduction system for FDE (also found in \cite{omori201740}).
